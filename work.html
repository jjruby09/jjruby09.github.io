                            My scientific foundation was built studying inertial confinement fusion
                            (ICF) and high-energy-density (HED) physics — regimes where intense
                            laser pulses drive matter to extreme pressures and temperatures. My
                            Ph.D. thesis, <em>Bayesian Inference of Fundamental Physics at Extreme
                                Conditions</em>, developed new statistical frameworks for extracting
