                Science is the iterative process of building models of how nature
                works, testing them against data, and updating your beliefs
                accordingly. That's Bayesian inference at its core — and it applies
                whether you're diagnosing a laser-driven fusion implosion or
                projecting a pitcher's future performance.

              My career has been structured around one question: <em>what can the
              data actually tell us?</em> Not what we want it to say, not what
              confirms existing intuition — what the signal actually supports once
              you've honestly accounted for the noise.
            </p>
            <p>
              I moved from experimental high-energy-density physics into professional
              baseball operations because the underlying methodology is identical.
              Both fields require constructing rigorous probabilistic models, running
              them against expensive experimental data, and making decisions under
              meaningful uncertainty with real consequences.
            </p>
            <p>
              The tools are Bayesian statistics, Monte Carlo methods, and the
              discipline to distinguish between a genuine result and a story you
              told yourself.

              My scientific foundation was built studying inertial confinement fusion
              (ICF) and high-energy-density (HED) physics — regimes where intense
              laser pulses drive matter to extreme pressures and temperatures to test
              fundamental models of plasma behavior.

        <p style="max-width:640px; margin-bottom:2rem;">
          These aren't aspirational statements — they're operating constraints.
          Violating them consistently produces bad science and bad organizations.
        </p>

        <div class="philosophy-grid">

            <h3>Servant Leadership</h3>
            <p>
              The job of leadership is to remove obstacles, provide clarity,
              and create conditions where talented people can do their best work.
              Authority is a tool for enabling others, not for self-amplification.
              Good decisions come from the person closest to the problem, not
              necessarily the most senior person in the room.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="principle">
            <h3>Integrity as a Practical Necessity</h3>
            <p>
              Intellectual honesty isn't a virtue signal — it's a prerequisite
              for doing useful work. In science and in sports analytics, the cost
              of believing a false model is real and measurable. Being honest about
              what the data says, including when it contradicts your prior or your
              preferred narrative, is the only sustainable path.

          <div class="principle">
            <h3>Psychological Safety &amp; Failure</h3>
            <p>
              Discovery requires being wrong. If the environment punishes people
              for surfacing a bad result, reporting a failed experiment, or
              disagreeing with leadership, you've destroyed your own feedback loop.
              Building high psychological safety isn't soft management — it's
              sound epistemology. The team that can fail openly is the team that
              learns fastest.
